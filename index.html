						  <ul>
						  	  <li><label>Healthy India egg products?</label><p>Whole Egg Liquid, Egg White Liquid, Egg Yellow Liquid, Egg Shell Powder.</p></li>
							  <li><label>Why and how are egg products pasteurized?</label><p>All egg liquid products by Healthy India are pasteurized. That means, they are rapidly heated and held at a minimum required temperature for a specified time. temperature is hot enough to kill bacteria but not enough to cook the eggs. This process does not affect their color, flavor, nutritional value, or use.</p>
							  <li><label>Can egg products consumed raw or uncooked?</label><p>Yes, they can be consumed uncooked as they are pasteurized but are best in cooked form, especially if served to high risk person like, infants, young children, pregnant women, older adults and person with weakened immune systems.</p></li>							  
							  <li><label>How to determine egg freshness?</label><p>We recommend you check the aroma for freshness prior to each use — refer to the best before date on the bottle/carton and discard if there is any odor present. The aroma of fresh egg whites resembles an eggy or dairy aroma — when egg whites are bad there’s a distinctive odor.</p></li>
							  <li><label>Storage and Usage?</label><p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Storage:</span> Keep product on the shelves of the fridge and not in the door where the temperature fluctuates a lot. 
							  <br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Usage:</span> Slight beating is recommended prior to use. 
							  <br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Handling:</span> Containers must be handled in an appropriate manner to prevent contamination.</p></li>
							  <li><label>How do i measure Egg Whites? - For baking..</label>3 tbsp of Egg White = 1 whole egg
							  <br>2 tbsp of Egg White = 1 egg whites
							  <br>½ cup of egg white = appx 4-5 egg whites</p></li>
							  <li><label>Shelf Life?</label><p>Our own personal tests have shown that Egg Whites, if maintained at 40 degrees or lower in the refrigerator, stay good for around 6 months, even when opened. However, we recommend that you use them in a month if opened to assure the best quality product.</p></li>
